Letâ€™s define a social network first before we dive into the concept of link prediction.

**A social network is essentially a representation of the relationships between social entities, such as people, organizations, governments, political parties, etc.**

The interactions among these entities generate unimaginable amounts of data in the form of posts, chat messages, tweets, likes, comments, shares, etc. This opens up a window of opportunities and use cases we can work on.

That brings us to Social Network Analytics (SNA). We can define it as a combination of several activities that are performed on social media. These activities include data collection from online social media sites and using that data to make business decisions.

The benefits of social network analytics can be highly rewarding. Here are a few key benefits:

- Helps you understand your audience better
- Used for customer segmentation
- Used to design Recommendation Systems
- Detect fake news, among other things
